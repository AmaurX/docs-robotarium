# Auto charging {#part:robotarium-auto-charging}

Maintainer: Julien Kindle, Thomas Ackermann

Duckiebots with a built-in 10400mAh battery are capable of driving for roughly 7 hours. Therefore to create a fully autonomous Duckietown, a charging station is a crucial part. This chapter describes how to setup and operate a charging area. It is highly recommended to have a 3D-printer available in order to tune the flexibility of some parts - if this is not the case, URLs for ordering the parts are provided.

Please keep in mind that this solution is still not perfect - in [](#autocharging-future), you can find the issues which should be solved.
